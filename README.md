A fictious E-Commerce Business Intelligence project

VS Group, a U.S. company with ambitions to expand their burgeoning E-Commerce business within the USA, faces two main challenges:

1. Modernize their outdated database structure: they seek to transition to a more sustainable SQL database solution to enhance operational efficiency and scalability. Your expertise and support are essential for achieving this goal.
2. Conduct a comprehensive competitive analysis: this endeavor aims to gather valuable insights that will inform their strategic approach and go-to market strategy.

## Competitive analysis

Competitive analysis is a crucial practice for businesses, whether they are startups or established players in the industry. It involves identifying key competitors and assessing their strategies to unveil their strengths, such as top-selling products, advertising strategies, market dominance, or areas where they excel. Conversely, weaknesses may encompass seasonal sales fluctuations, high shipping costs in specific regions, or gaps in market penetration.

Analyzing competitors in relation to your business, product offerings, customer segments, and market dynamics is an essential step. It serves as a safeguard against costly mistakes when entering new markets or adapting strategies in the ever-evolving business landscape.

This task requires you to understand the domain beforehand:

* Basic overview of the e-Commerce business model
* Name of the top 3 e-Commerce retailers in the USA
* Who might be some interesting competitors to analyze?
